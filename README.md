Yo, welcome to Sensei Seagal â€“ Rapid Recon ðŸŒ´ðŸ¥‹

Hear mi now, cyber-bredren:
this bash ting roll through di network like Casey Ryback on a jet-ski, spittinâ€™ packets faster than a dance-hall riddim.

-Turbo scan mode â€“ timing 4, one retry, nuff packets per second. (Ease off di throttle by changinâ€™ RATE, RETRIES, TEMPLATE up top if di IoT boxes start cryinâ€™).

-No chatty output â€“ tools stay silent; colourful progress bars tell ya how di mission cookinâ€™.

-Round-house coverage â€“ ping sweep, service enum, big bucket aâ€™ NSE scripts, Modbus UDP, httpx web sniff, plus an optional all-out vuln barrage.

-Loot neatly stashed under loot/ with clean IP lists for every port â€“ so you dig through results like treasure, seen?

-Commentary straight from a reggae-Seagal mash-up â€“ â€˜cause dull scans are for rookies.
